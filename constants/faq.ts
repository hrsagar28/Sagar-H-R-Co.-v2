    category: "Income Tax & Planning",
    question: "How do I choose between the Old and New Tax Regime?",
    answer: "The New Tax Regime offers lower tax rates but disallows most common deductions (like 80C, 80D, HRA). The Old Tax Regime has higher rates but allows you to claim these deductions. The better choice depends on your income and investment profile. We can help you with a detailed comparison to see which regime saves you more tax."

    question: "My business is making a loss. Do I still need to file an income tax return?",
    answer: "Yes, it is highly recommended. Filing a tax return even when you have a loss allows you to carry forward that loss to future years. This means you can offset the loss against future profits, which will reduce your tax liability in profitable years."

    category: "Income Tax & Planning",
    question: "How can proactive tax planning save me money?",
    answer: "Tax planning is about more than just filing returns on time. It involves strategically structuring your financial affairs throughout the year to legally minimize your tax liability. By planning ahead, you can take full advantage of all available deductions, exemptions, and rebates, ensuring you don't pay more tax than you are legally required to."

    category: "Income Tax & Planning",
    question: "I sold some shares/mutual funds this year. How is the profit taxed?",
    answer: "Profits from the sale of shares or mutual funds are taxed under the head 'Capital Gains'. The tax rate depends on whether the gain is short-term or long-term, which is determined by how long you held the asset. The rules can be complex, so it's important to have them calculated correctly."

  {
    category: "Income Tax & Planning",
    question: "I am planning to sell a property. What are the tax implications I should be aware of beforehand?",
    answer: "The sale of a property results in capital gains, which are taxable. Key factors determining the tax are the holding period (long-term vs. short-term), the cost of acquisition, improvement costs, and the sale price. It's crucial to plan this in advance as there are several exemptions available (like re-investing in another property or specified bonds) that can significantly reduce or even nullify your tax liability. We strongly advise a consultation before you finalize the sale."

It is also mandatory for certain other businesses regardless of turnover, such as e-commerce operators or those making inter-state sales."
  },
